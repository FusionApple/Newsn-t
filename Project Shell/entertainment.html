			<h3>Nickelodean Announces New Movie</h3>

			<p>Producers announced the movie will be about the horrific year of 2020. There is no definite release date, but they said it should release sometime during the holiday season of 2021. There is no definite name for the movie as well. I believe everyone can agree that this production will possibly be worse than the year 2020 itself. Who would want to relive this year and watch an actual movie about a viral pandemic that completely changed the world we live in for the worse. Like common! How could they think this would be a good idea? I hope Nick receives enough negative feedback as a result of this announcement that they cancel the movie. If this doesn’t happen, at least we’ll all be able to laugh at how Nickelodean will make no money from its release. More to come when Nick makes more definite announcements, which will include us definitely making fun of them for this terrible decision.</p>
