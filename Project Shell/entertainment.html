			<h3>Nickelodean Announces New Movie</h3>

			<img class="media-img" id = 'mobile'src="images/Nick.jpeg" >

			<p>Producers announced the movie will be about the horrific year of 2020. There is no definite release date, but they said it should release sometime during the holiday season of 2021. There is no definite name for the movie as well. I believe everyone can agree that this production will possibly be worse than the year 2020 itself. Who would want to relive this year and watch an actual movie about a viral pandemic that completely changed the world we live in for the worse. Like common! How could they think this would be a good idea? I hope Nick receives enough negative feedback as a result of this announcement that they cancel the movie. If this doesn’t happen, at least we’ll all be able to laugh at how Nickelodean will make no money from its release. More to come when Nick makes more definite announcements, which will include us definitely making fun of them for this terrible decision.</p>

			<h3>Celebrity Family Deathly Afraid of COVID</h3>

			<img class="media-img" id = 'mobile' src="images/island.jpeg" >

			<p>All because of the sudden resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic, the Kardashians have made it official that they are refusing to leave their house. Of course they had to make news like this public to everybody. Their entire family are apparently now deathly afraid of the virus and possibly testing positive for it. So, they have made their new humongous private island their “bubble” to quarantine in. They’ve told us that they have spent weeks preparing for the possible resurgence of COVID-19. In order to do that, they have gone to supermarkets, makeup stores, and other places to get their completely necessary supplies for their upcoming quarantine. They have gone to these places in full on hazmat suits, and they have worn signs that make it clear that they do not want to be near anyone at all unless they absolutely have to. No one knows how much time they will be spending on their quarantine vacation, but we do know that they have spent over 5 million dollars preparing for it. This is a bit overkill and a little over dramatic in our opinion. But, it’s the Kardashians we’re dealing with, so what else can we expect. They’re deathly, deathly afraid of this virus all of a sudden, so I suppose we have to respect their decisions. I just hope they don’t get bored in that 50 million dollar island they’ll be on.</p>
