				<h3>New Scientific Discovery: The Universe is a marble.</h3>

				<img class="media-img" id = 'mobile' src="images/marble.jpeg">

				<p>Scientists at NASA have recently uncovered the most shocking discovery in history. The universe originally thought to be continuously expanding is actually contained within a marble. Much like the popular movie Men In Black it is theorized that there are a vast number of universes currently residing in separate marbles which exist within an ‘Origin’ universe.</p>

				<h3>Researchers Go On Strike After Discovering That Neither the Chicken Nor the Egg Came First</h3>

				<img class="media-img" id = 'mobile' src="images/chicken.jpeg">
				<p>	Researchers from the Tyson Chicken company were trekking the Saharra Desert for fossils of ancient chickens to conduct intensive market research as well as add an exhibit to their "Worlds Largest Chicken Museum". During their trek, not only did scientists find the chicken fosils they were searching for, they also found shards of what once was a shell. The scientists were amazed that a fragile egg shell was preserved in the intense climate of the desert and rushed back to the lab to conduct tests on the sample.
				Upon testing the shell along with the fossils, researchers found that the age of the compounds in both items were exactly the same down to the milisecond. This caused outrage amongst the science community who pledged to keep the answer to the paradox a secret, and because of this, researchers nationwide refused to go into work.</p>
