				<h3><a name="001"></a>Florida Man Accidentally Finds the Cure For Covid-19</h3>
				
					<p>On October 13, what we’ve all been waiting for has finally happened, the end to the horrible virus, COVID-19. And somehow, some way, to everyone, literally everyone’s surprise, a random Florida man has done it. Like who would’ve thought. Absolutely no one if I were to be honest with you! This man, who’s name is Ronald Weslon, is everyone’s apparent savior. The story of how Mr. Weslon has done this miraculous, unintentional act is utterly unbelievable. Also, it is somewhat illegal. 
					Being a classic Florida man, Mr. Weslon had weirdly snuck into the University of Miami’s chemistry laboratories. I don’t believe local authorities even know how this 31 year old ended up there. After stumbling upon multiple chemistry projects that were coincidentally all in one place in the lab. Mr. Weslon, who told us that he was bored out of his mind in the university and really had nothing else better to do, decided it would be a fantastic idea to combine, I believe, 3 student’s projects with different chemicals inside of them. The specifics of these chemicals are still unknown, but are being determined. Mr. Weslon then decided to bring his new concoction back home. He then randomly decided to throw a party the next day. Ronald coincidentally, again, combined his new concoction with some alcoholic beverages for his guests. This isn’t even the worst part. Apparently, some of his party guests had COVID-19, and I would say they just didn’t care about the health, well-being, and safety of others. These disgusting people were among the group who drank this new beverage of Mr. Weslon’s, and to their surprise, were instantly cured of the virus. Ronald Weslon is now in question as to why the hell he snuck onto a college campus and why he served his guests a beverage with numerous potential harmful chemicals. More to come!</p>

						<p>I’m not sure if this man should be praised or arrested LOL. I guess we should all be happy that this somehow happened all of a sudden, and that COVID will not finally be not a thing anymore! I wonder when the scientists will discover the specific chemicals that were mixed into his party drinks. Whenever they do the world should be ecstatic right now.</p>
