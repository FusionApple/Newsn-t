				<h3>MoMA Horrified to Learn That “Pineapple Juice” was Replaced with Apple Juice</h3>
				
				<p>It is a sad day for both the Museum of Modern Art and the art community as a whole. On October 30th at 3:00 AM, a security guard discovered that “Pineapple Juice”, an art piece by the famous Jean-Pierre Claude Emmettson III, had been stolen from its pedestal and replaced with a bottle of apple juice. “It was absolutely awful,” said the security guard in an interview. “I was making the standard rounds one night, when I suddenly recognized the distinct sweet scent of Motts<sup>tm</sup> all-organic apple juice in the air. I immediately ran to the “Pineapple Juice”, to find it had been replaced with a bottle of delicious Motts<sup>tm</sup> apple juice! Normally I would be happy to find a refreshing bottle of Motts<sup>tm</sup> apple juice (now available in grocery stores everywhere), but I knew that this was different. I was the first witness to a tragedy.” Jean-Pierre Claude Emmettson III declined to an interview, citing emotional distress from the theft of his art piece. “Pineapple Juice was everything to me,” the artist said. “It was my magnum opus. I am horrified by this senseless act of vandalism.” Truly, the loss of “Pineapple Juice” marks a great loss for the art community. We can only hope that it will be recovered in due time.</p>

				<h3>Venus de Milo Restored to Critical Acclaim</h3>
				
				<p>After years of waiting, the Venus de Milo, one of the Louvre’s most renowned art pieces, has been restored to its original glory. While the original piece lacked arms, a Swedish artist known by the name of F. Kjellberg was authorized to restore the piece six months ago. Now the wait is finally over, and the art community is floored by Mr. Kjellberg’s masterful restoration. “I wanted to do something new and fresh, something to keep the piece relevant”, said Kjellberg in an interview. “The way Venus is posed needs to be timeless and ethereal…yet something that is definitely still fresh and hasn’t lost all relevance years ago.” The restoration has been universally praised by artists and critics alike, and the Venus de Milo seems to have yet again been established as a defining masterpiece in the history of art.</p>
