				<h3>MoMA Horrified to Learn That “Piss Bottle” was Replaced with Apple Juice</h3>
				
				<p>It is a sad day for both the Museum of Modern Art and the art community as a whole. On October 30th at 3:00 AM, a security guard discovered that “Piss Bottle”, an art piece by the famous Jean-Pierre Claude Emmettson III, had been stolen from its pedestal and replaced with a bottle of apple juice. “It was absolutely awful,” said the security guard in an interview. “I was making the standard rounds one night, when I suddenly recognized the distinct sweet scent of Motts<sup>tm</sup> all-organic apple juice in the air. I immediately ran to the “Piss Bottle”, to find it had been replaced with a bottle of delicious Motts<sup>tm</sup> apple juice! Normally I would be happy to find a refreshing bottle of Motts<sup>tm</sup> apple juice (now available in grocery stores everywhere), but I knew that this was different. I was the first witness to a tragedy.” Jean-Pierre Claude Emmettson III declined to an interview, citing emotional distress from the theft of his art piece. “Piss Bottle was everything to me,” the artist said. “It was my magnum opus. I am horrified by this senseless act of vandalism.” Truly, the loss of “Piss Bottle” marks a great loss for the art community. We can only hope that it will be recovered in due time.</p>
