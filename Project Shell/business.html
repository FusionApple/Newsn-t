				<h3>Stocks Rise as Disney Acquires the US Government</h3>
				
				<p>After yet another series of mergers and acquisitions, the Walt Disney company has bought out the US government, a company which has been slowly falling in market value for the past 20 years. This marks a tremendous victory for Disney, which has had its eye on this acquisition for years. “Stock prices have never been higher,” says Bob Chapek, CEO of Walt Disney Inc. “Everyone is buying, eager to hold some share in the new Disney government.” Executives have publicly submitted a six-step process to revive the floundering company, which they’ve named the M.I.C.K.E.Y. plan. The acronym stands for the following: <ul><li><b>Monetary Re-branding.</b><br></li>Dollar bills and coins have enormous advertising potential that is currently unused. Under this plan, US dollars will now be referred to as “Mouse Money”, and will contain portraits of classic Disney characters.<br><li><b>Incentivize Loyalty.</b><br></li>US citizens will now have a “citizen score” which tracks how morally upstanding they are. A high citizen score will give its holder discounts, job security, and other special privileges. The citizen score increases whenever you purchase Disney products, and decreases whenever you buy from one of Disney’s competitors.<br><li><b>Congressional and Legislative Disbandment.</b><br></li>The congressional and legislative branches of the US government will be disbanded, effective immediately. All powers and responsibilities previously held by these branches will be transferred to the executive branch.<br><li><b>Kill the Competition.</b><br></li>This step of the plan is entirely metaphorical. Despite Walt Disney’s sudden access to high-tech military technology, we will not be ruthlessly hunting down our competitors. Any sudden and violent deaths of CEOs of rival companies are entirely coincidental.<br><li><b>Executive Takeover.</b><br></li>The executive branch of the US government will now be managed and run by Walt Disney Inc. We will be disbanding the process of elections, and the office of the president will now belong to the CEO of Walt Disney Inc. There are no longer any term limits for this office.<br><li><b>Yield to Mickey.</b><br></li>There is no escape. Mickey sees all. Lawbreakers will be brought to justice, and the mouse is not merciful. Kneel before your new god.</ul>As we can see, it’s a wonderful day for those who hold shares in Walt Disney Inc. The company’s prospects are expected only to rise, and this arrangement will grant a financial boost to many. All hail the mouse.</p>
