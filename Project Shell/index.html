					<h3>Florida man accidentally finds the cure for Covid-19</h3>
				
					<p >On October 13, what we’ve all been waiting for has finally happened, the end to the horrible virus, COVID-19. And somehow, some way, to everyone, literally everyone’s surprise, a random Florida man has done it. Like who would’ve thought. Absolutely no one if I were to be honest with you! This man, who’s name is Ronald Weslon, is everyone’s apparent savior. The story of how Mr. Weslon has done this miraculous, unintentional act is utterly unbelievable. Also, it is somewhat illegal. 
					Being a classic Florida man, Mr. Weslon had weirdly snuck into the University of Miami’s chemistry laboratories. I don’t believe local authorities even know how this 31 year old ended up there. After stumbling upon multiple chemistry projects that were coincidentally all in one place in the lab. Mr. Weslon, who told us that he was bored out of his mind in the university and really had nothing else better to do, decided it would be a fantastic idea to combine, I believe, 3 student’s projects with different chemicals inside of them. The specifics of these chemicals are still unknown, but are being determined. Mr. Weslon then decided to bring his new concoction back home. He then randomly decided to throw a party the next day. Ronald coincidentally, again, combined his new concoction with some alcoholic beverages for his guests. This isn’t even the worst part. Apparently, some of his party guests had COVID-19, and I would say they just didn’t care about the health, well-being, and safety of others. These disgusting people were among the group who drank this new beverage of Mr. Weslon’s, and to their surprise, were instantly cured of the virus. Ronald Weslon is now in question as to why the hell he snuck onto a college campus and why he served his guests a beverage with numerous potential harmful chemicals. More to come!</p>

				<h3>Presidential Election Cancelled Due to a Light Drizzle</h3>
			
				<p>The presidential election, which was set to take place on October 21, 2020, was shockingly canceled and now postponed to a much later date due to a light drizzle. I believe everyone can agree that these slight weather conditions should not have resulted in a cancellation. I believe the whole nation was just absolutely disappointed with not only the candidates, but also the group who was involved in the final decision to postpone the entire election. The whole nation was finally prepared to vote for their new President, but now it seems we will all have to wait a few more months. The so-called “nationwide torrential hurricane” did not even seem that bad. It was only absolutely pouring rain in a majority of the states. It completely drenched whoever dared to step outside. Not too many streets and highways were completely flooded, and the sewers really couldn’t keep up with the amount of rain there was, but who even really cares about that. I was told around only a few thousand trees were knocked down, but in my opinion, that’s not enough to stop an election. I believe a bridge completely collapsed because of the amount of rain there was which I don’t think is that big of a deal. Additionally, the numbers are still currently being added up, but there were a countless amount of deaths that occurred as a result of this storm.
				Maybe this storm was slightly worse than I’m making it out to be. But still. These results of this little storm should definitely not be the reason for the cancellation of a crucial presidential election! I honestly still cannot believe these utterly ridiculous turn of events. With a little over 75% of the United States declaring a national emergency because of this storm, the election should have still occurred.</p>

					<h3>New York Giants Misplaced all The Team's Footballs Causing Season to End Early</h3>
			
					<p>In one of the most disheartening events of the year, New York Giants coach Joe Judge confirmed in an interview that the football team had misplaced all 175 of its footballs, forcing them to resign from the 2020 season. “It’s a shame, really” said coach Judge when confronted about the issue. “We were really looking forward to the season, and we were sure that this was gonna be our year. But the footballs disappeared, and we have to live with that. These things happen.” While the footballs have not yet been found, speculation still runs wild among the fans. Some even claim that the footballs were stolen. “I saw it, I swear!” claimed one disgruntled fan when asked about the incident. “My dash camera from the parking lot caught it all on tape! Tom Brady was driving away with all of the balls in the back of a pickup truck!” While his claims about Patriots quarterback have been confirmed, there is no clear evidence to state that the footage of Tom Brady is related to the incident. “I carry around hundreds of footballs in my truck all the time” refuted Brady when asked for a comment. “You can’t prove that those balls weren’t mine.” While some fans dispute this, Brady has stood strong in the face of these wild accusations. Perhaps someday we’ll truly know what happened to those dozens of footballs during the 2020 season.</p>
