					<h3><a name="001"></a>Presidential Election Canceled Due to a Light Drizzle</h3>
					
					<img class="media-img" id = 'mobile' src="images/light_storm.jpg">
					
					<p>The presidential election, which was set to take place on October 21, 2020, was shockingly canceled and now postponed to a much later date due to a light drizzle. I believe everyone can agree that these slight weather conditions should not have resulted in a cancellation. I believe the whole nation was just absolutely disappointed with not only the candidates, but also the group who was involved in the final decision to postpone the entire election. The whole nation was finally prepared to vote for their new President, but now it seems we will all have to wait a few more months. The so-called “nationwide torrential hurricane” did not even seem that bad. It was only absolutely pouring rain in a majority of the states. It completely drenched whoever dared to step outside. Not too many streets and highways were completely flooded, and the sewers really couldn’t keep up with the amount of rain there was, but who even really cares about that. I was told around only a few thousand trees were knocked down, but in my opinion, that’s not enough to stop an election. I believe a bridge completely collapsed because of the amount of rain there was which I don’t think is that big of a deal. Additionally, the numbers are still currently being added up, but there were a countless amount of deaths that occurred as a result of this storm.
					Maybe this storm was slightly worse than I’m making it out to be. But still. These results of this little storm should definitely not be the reason for the cancellation of a crucial presidential election! I honestly still cannot believe these utterly ridiculous turn of events. With a little over 75% of the United States declaring a national emergency because of this storm, the election should have still occurred.</p>

							<p>ARE YOU GUYS ABSOLUTELY INSANE?!?!?! It literally states the perfect reasons as to why it should’ve definitely been cancelled. ALMOST EVERY SINGLE STATE IN THE UNITED STATES HAD TO DECLARE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY BECAUSE OF THIS “LITTLE STORM” THAT YOU ARE MENTIONING. I can’t believe I just read what was said in this article. This is crazy...</p>

					<h3><a name="002"></a>First Lady Gone Missing</h3>
			
					<img class="media-img" id = 'mobile'src="images/melania.png">

					<p>This is breaking news! The first lady, Melania Trump, has somehow gone missing. It was reported that last night her and President Trump were having an intense argument over what the best hair products are for Donald’s hair. Mr. President was apparently being oddly and extremely stubborn and opposed to Melania’s opinions and suggestions. However, our sources are baffled about why the President was being so dam difficult. No one is sure what even happened to Melania. Some say that Mr. Trump locked her in the Whitehouse basement, and others believe she went incognito and ran away. Truly a tragedy. Oh well. Hopefully the first lady turns up eventually, so she and the President could apologize to each other. Let’s hope Melania Trump hasn’t truly disappeared. We’ll see what happens!</p>
