		<h3>Florida Man Accidentally Finds the Cure for COVID-19:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>I’m not sure if this man should be praised or arrested LOL. I guess we should all be happy that this somehow happened all of a sudden, and that COVID will not finally be not a thing anymore! I wonder when the scientists will discover the specific chemicals that were mixed into his party drinks. Whenever they do the world should be ecstatic right now.</li>
			<li>LET’S GOOOOOO THIS MAN IS AWESOME I WANNA GO TO AND CELEBRATE AT ONE OF HIS PARTIES</li>
			<li>COVID-19 gone...pandemic is over...Wow, I thought I’d never hear or see these words for the next couple of years. What a relief. I’ve been really over this for the past month. I’m so happy. #MasksOff</li>

			<h3>Presidential Election Postponed due to a Light Drizzle:</h3>

			<ul>

				<li>ARE YOU GUYS ABSOLUTELY INSANE?!?!?! It literally states the perfect reasons as to why it should’ve definitely been cancelled. ALMOST EVERY SINGLE STATE IN THE UNITED STATES HAD TO DECLARE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY BECAUSE OF THIS “LITTLE STORM” THAT YOU ARE MENTIONING. I can’t believe I just read what was said in this article. This is crazy...</li>
