						<h3><a name="001"></a>New York Giants Misplaced all The Team's Footballs Causing Season to End Early</h3>

						<img class="media-img" id = 'mobile' src="images/footballs.jpg">
			
						<p>In one of the most disheartening events of the year, New York Giants coach Joe Judge confirmed in an interview that the football team had misplaced all 175 of its footballs, forcing them to resign from the 2020 season. “It’s a shame, really” said coach Judge when confronted about the issue. “We were really looking forward to the season, and we were sure that this was gonna be our year. But the footballs disappeared, and we have to live with that. These things happen.” While the footballs have not yet been found, speculation still runs wild among the fans. Some even claim that the footballs were stolen. “I saw it, I swear!” claimed one disgruntled fan when asked about the incident. “My dash camera from the parking lot caught it all on tape! Tom Brady was driving away with all of the balls in the back of a pickup truck!” While his claims about Patriots quarterback have been confirmed, there is no clear evidence to state that the footage of Tom Brady is related to the incident. “I carry around hundreds of footballs in my truck all the time” refuted Brady when asked for a comment. “You can’t prove that those balls weren’t mine.” While some fans dispute this, Brady has stood strong in the face of these wild accusations. Perhaps someday we’ll truly know what happened to those dozens of footballs during the 2020 season.</p>

						<h3><a name="002"></a>Hockey Brawl Gone Absolutely Brutal</h3>
			
						<img class="media-img" id = 'mobile' src="images/fight.jpeg">

						<p>	Bitter rivals, the New York Rangers and the New Jersey Devils, had a way too intense matchup last night. So intense that the match was forcibly stopped by the referees in the first period because of a brutal team versus team brawl. It all started after left wing, Alexis Lafreniere, scored a goal 5 minutes into the first period. He and the entire rangers team were hyped that they started the game on such a positive note. Centerman, Ryan Strome, was so hyped up and excited that he screamed at the top of his lungs, “THE DEVILS SUCK!” The Devils did not take this extremely hurtful comment lightly. So, as a result, right wing, Kyle Palmieri, went over to Strome and punched him so hard, that Strome was knocked out cold on the ice. This was maybe a little unnecessary, but we guess his feelings were hurt by Strome’s comment. After this happened, a full and complete team brawl occurred. The teams were punching, slapping, and kicking each other all over the hockey rink. Players and somehow the referees as well, were laying all over the ice. The Rangers head coach even got involved by flanking the Devils coach and slapping him hard across the face. The fight eventually ended when more referees were sent to break everyone up and help the multiple injured people. Both teams, as a result, are now suspended for the entire 2021 season.</p>
