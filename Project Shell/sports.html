					<h3><a name="001"></a>New York Giants Misplaced all The Team's Footballs Causing Season to End Early</h3>
			
					<p>In one of the most disheartening events of the year, New York Giants coach Joe Judge confirmed in an interview that the football team had misplaced all 175 of its footballs, forcing them to resign from the 2020 season. “It’s a shame, really” said coach Judge when confronted about the issue. “We were really looking forward to the season, and we were sure that this was gonna be our year. But the footballs disappeared, and we have to live with that. These things happen.” While the footballs have not yet been found, speculation still runs wild among the fans. Some even claim that the footballs were stolen. “I saw it, I swear!” claimed one disgruntled fan when asked about the incident. “My dash camera from the parking lot caught it all on tape! Tom Brady was driving away with all of the balls in the back of a pickup truck!” While his claims about Patriots quarterback have been confirmed, there is no clear evidence to state that the footage of Tom Brady is related to the incident. “I carry around hundreds of footballs in my truck all the time” refuted Brady when asked for a comment. “You can’t prove that those balls weren’t mine.” While some fans dispute this, Brady has stood strong in the face of these wild accusations. Perhaps someday we’ll truly know what happened to those dozens of footballs during the 2020 season.</p>
